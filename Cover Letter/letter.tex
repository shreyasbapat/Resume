I am writing to express my interest in the posting of Systems Software Engineer at STScI. I am currently pursuing Bachelor of Technology  in Electrical Engineering  at Indian Institute of Technology, Mandi and will get my degree in spring 2020.  I have contributed in open source astronomy packages like Astropy, poliastro and other Astropy affiliated packages. Adding on to this, i have hands on experience of starting and maintaining a Python package related to General Relativity : EinsteinPy, and i am confident that I will be asset to your organization.

I enjoy being challenged and engaging with projects that require me to work outside my comfort and knowledge set, as continuing to learn new languages and development techniques are important to me and the success of your organization.

Your listed requirements closely match my background and skills. I would like to have your glimpse on the part of my skill set, that would enable me to contribute to the bottom line. They are as follows :

\begin{itemize}
    \item Proficiency in advanced Python as well as compiled languages such as C, C++.
    \item Using context managers, exception handling, iterators, decorators, closures and lambda functions, and threading
    \item Comfortable with writing unit tests and with test-driven development
    \item Comfortable developing primarily in and for a Unix/Linux environment (experience with supporting Python on Windows as well)
    \item Experience writing technical documentation using sphinx.
    \item Experience with software library development and library API design and have developed and maintained large software projects with complicated interacting components. I have developed EinsteinPy and parts of poliastro.
    \item Familiarity with git workflows and with continuous-integration frameworks like CircleCI, TravisCI, Azure Pipelines.
\end{itemize}

I have attached a copy of my resume that details my projects and experience in software development. I can be reached anytime via my cell phone, +91 913-185-1172 or via email at bapat.shreyas@gmail.com.
